# CheatStop Emulator (Movement Simulator based on Neo)
## About
This essentially emulates Minecrsft game code to predict where a player will be based on data. CheatStop usds it to detect players using movement cheats.

Neo is a barebones, basic movement emulator for Minecraft's Java Edition physics (for version 1.8)

## Disclaimer
Neo comes with absolutely no warranty or support, use at your own risk.

Neo is not intended to be used as provided, it is a base to understand movement emulation and continue to add support for
further scenarios.

Comments have been left in places where fixes are required.

***NEO IS CURRENTLY UNTESTED. EXPECT ISSUES***

## What's missing?
- Ladders - comments have been left where they need to be implemented. Refer to MCP
- Potion effects - to be implemented in jumping and aiMoveSpeed
- Water and lava movement - to be implemented in move entity with heading. Refer to MCP
- Motion and bounding boxes for colliding blocks - look in `me.hydro.emulator.collision`. Refer to MCP
- Velocity/Knockback
- Post 1.8 clients

## Usage
Each player you're emulating should have their own `Emulator` object.

On a flying packet, call `Emulator#runIteration` with an `IterationInput` object, which can be created like so;

```
final IterationInput iteration = IterationInput.builder()
    .to(...) // location from the flying packet
    .yaw(...) // current yaw
    .ground(...)
    .jumping(...) // you'll want to bruteforce this
    .forward(...) // you'll want to bruteforce this
    .strafing(...) // you'll want to bruteforce this
    .sprinting(...) // you'll want to bruteforce this
    .usingItem(...) // you'll want to bruteforce this
    .hitSlowdown(...) // you'll want to bruteforce this
    .sneaking(...)
    .lastReportedBoundingBox(...) // from location, as a bounding box
    .build();
```

This method returns an `IterationResult` object.

Upon finding the correct result, run `Emulator#confirm` on the `IterationHolder` received from the `IterationResult.`

A demo in code can be found in the `com.example` package.
